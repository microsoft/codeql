## 1.3.0

### New Queries

* Query (`go/html-template-escaping-bypass-xss`) has been promoted to the main query suite. This query finds potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when using the `html/template` package, caused by user input being cast to a type which bypasses the HTML autoescaping. It was originally contributed to the experimental query pack by @gagliardetto in <https://github.com/github/codeql-go/pull/493>.
