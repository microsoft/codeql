## 0.6.0

### Breaking Changes

* The following queries have been removed from the `security-and-quality` suite.
  They are not intended to produce user-facing
  alerts describing vulnerabilities.
  Any existing alerts for these queries will be closed automatically.
  * `actions/composite-action-sinks`
  * `actions/composite-action-sources`
  * `actions/composite-action-summaries`
  * `actions/reusable-workflow-sinks`
    (renamed from `actions/reusable-wokflow-sinks`)
  * `actions/reusable-workflow-sources`
  * `actions/reusable-workflow-summaries`

### Bug Fixes

* Assigned a `security-severity` to the query `actions/excessive-secrets-exposure`.
