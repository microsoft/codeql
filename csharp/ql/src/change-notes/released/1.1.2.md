## 1.1.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Changes to the MaD model generation infrastructure:
  * Changed the query `cs/utils/modelgenerator/summary-models` to use the implementation from `cs/utils/modelgenerator/mixed-summary-models`.
  * Removed the now-redundant `cs/utils/modelgenerator/mixed-summary-models` query.
  * A similar replacement was made for `cs/utils/modelgenerator/neutral-models`. That is, if `GenerateFlowModel.py` is provided with `--with-summaries`, combined/mixed models are now generated instead of heuristic models (and similar for `--with-neutrals`).
* Improved detection of authorization checks in the `cs/web/missing-function-level-access-control` query. The query now recognizes authorization attributes inherited from base classes and interfaces.
* The precision of the query `cs/invalid-string-formatting` has been improved. More methods and more overloads of existing format like methods are taken into account by the query.
