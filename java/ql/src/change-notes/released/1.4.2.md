## 1.4.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Changes to the MaD model generation infrastructure:
  * Changed the query `java/utils/modelgenerator/summary-models` to use the implementation from `java/utils/modelgenerator/mixed-summary-models`.
  * Removed the now-redundant `java/utils/modelgenerator/mixed-summary-models` query.
  * A similar replacement was made for `java/utils/modelgenerator/neutral-models`. That is, if `GenerateFlowModel.py` is provided with `--with-summaries`, combined/mixed models are now generated instead of heuristic models (and similar for `--with-neutrals`).
