## 7.3.0

### Deprecated APIs

* The predicate `getValue()` on `SpringRequestMappingMethod` is now deprecated. Use `getAValue()` instead.
* Java now uses the shared `BasicBlock` library. This means that the names of several member predicates have been changed to align with the names used in other languages. The old predicates have been deprecated. The `BasicBlock` class itself no longer extends `ControlFlowNode` - the predicate `getFirstNode` can be used to fix any QL code that somehow relied on this.
